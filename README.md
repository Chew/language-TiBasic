Hey Vsauce, Michael here. What is, this repository? Well, let's break it down.

What is Ti-Basic? Ti-Basic is the language found on Ti-84 calculators, probably. I use it a lot.

What's a language? Idk.

What's this for? [Atom](http://atom.io)

## Disclaimer

This is more of a "How do languages in Atom work?" and I'm really just trying my best here. PRs are welcome.

Something not working? Feel free to report it as an [issue](http://github.com/Chew/language-TiBasic/issues).
